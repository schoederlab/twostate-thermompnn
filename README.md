This github repo contains a jupyter notebook which was used for the difference map calculation of the following paper:

Stabilization of viral glycoproteins in prefusion conformation using ThermoMPNN with negative state design

![graphical-abstract](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f99c2c2-9981-4158-b3c8-37dd6d81d061)


the repo also contains a ``` rosetta ``` folder, which contains the necessary scripts for the biophysical analysis. Please be aware that these scripts are optimized for viral glycoproteins, which are multimeric proteins. You need to create a symmetry file beforehand.
