# twostate-thermompnn

This github repo contains a jupyter notebook which was used for the difference map calculation of the following paper:

Stabilization of viral glycoproteins in prefusion conformation using ThermoMPNN with negative state design

![graphical-abstract](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11dfff04-20c3-439e-81de-6b01be99f8c0)

the repo also contains a """rosetta""" folder, which contains the necessary scripts for the biophysical analysis. Please be aware that these scripts are optimized for viral glycoproteins, which are multimeric proteins. You need to create a symmetry file beforehand.


WORK IN PROGRESS
